Attached is the link to access my HTML document as a whole as it is too large for GitHub to process.


## Question 3
C) 
- <div>What elements of your partner's code helped you to understand their data pipeline?</div> 
I was particularly impressed with the cleaning section of the code since the student made use of new inclusions within the code learnt from the session to help improve the cleaning process. I also enjoyed the presence of interactive plots which made me feel like I was getting the necessary information from the graph as a whole since it was easy to see the overall distribution, but also specific detail was available if needed. This helped me then see how they were answering their biological question from the code which is great! I also think an appropriate test was chosen for the type of variables that they were using (ANOVA). I was pleasantly surprised to see a post-hoc test being conducted too! (Tukey HSD).

- <div>Did it run?</div> 
Yes, I downloaded the markdown from the GitHub and ran it in my RStudio. I then found that there was a slight issue with regards to the naming of the chunks within the curly brackets. This would result in an error, where it referred to a zero-length variable name, however the code would work when just the code was ran! Therefore, I ran it in chunks and made sure the notes about the discussion and such would not interfere with the process.

-	<div>Any suggestions?</div>
One suggestion would be to either justify or remove the density function on the interactive violin plot. Although the interaction of the points are very useful to understand the data, it is hard to see how the density provides sufficient information and this has not been mentioned within the comments. Another suggestion would just be to remove the names of chunks within the {r} so the markdown can run all at once. Perhaps it would be useful to have a few more comments on the interpretation of the ANOVA or steps taken in general, because although there were some comments, it would make it more understandable for someone who may not be from a biological background. An AIC could have also been conducted to justify the use of the ANOVA.

- <div>If need to alter, would be easy or not?</div>
I think it would be easy to alter the figures of my partner since there are comments on almost each line or before the code is conducted to give sufficient context. The code is also quite clear and not complex, so it would be straightforward for me! I particularly liked the way a comment clarified how alpha must be altered to have differing transparency so that we can avoid over plotting.
