# To begin with my 'bad' plot is a grouped bar graph to show the distribution of different species on their respective islands. This graph can mislead the reader about the data since the bars are stacked on top of each other so it can give the wrong impression about the mean body mass per species on the island. Stacked bars are quite complex and therefore it is hard to interpret differences between species well and their respective contribution to the overall bar. This misunderstanding is further catalysed when comparing against the islands as one may assume the height of the bar represents the sum rather than the mass per species. Additionally, since mean body mass is used, the variation in the body mass may not be represented well as extreme values will just skew the mean but this would not be clearly visualised and therefore is hard to notice without the raw data.

# Perhaps it would have been better with a piece of code, such as: position = "dodge", within the geom_bar() aesthetics to separate the bars per species on the island. Feel free to add that in and see how the graph looks! It is still not completely clear as the width of the bars are still quite large, but it does help provide a clearer image.

# Additionally, the colours chosen are not accessible since this affects people with red-green colour-blindness, so it would be hard for them to discern the difference between where each species starts and ends, and this is still a problem even when position = “dodge” is added.

# A good plot tends to follow four main rules: clear graphics, accurate magnitude representation, patterns displayed well and clear data display. This graph violates all of them.

This is because it is not saved directly to my computer. penguins_raw is a file within the Palmer penguins data set, which is why I can just use the head function on it.

## Introduction: 
# Does size always correlate with size? Although this sounds like a peculiar question, one may argue this is a valid and pertinent question to ask. This is because this misunderstood principle is often used as preliminary research within the biological field. For example, when understanding neural networks, it is often assumed a bigger brain may correlate with increased intelligence based on an assumption that more connections are formed due to a larger volume. However, based on recent research, this seems to have been strongly opposed, for example: fruit flies, although small have complex neural networks as opposed to the hippopotamus. (Nave et al, 2018) [1].
# Therefore, this was the driving factor for my question, does culmen depth correlate with a larger body mass?
# This was based on what was available on the palmer penguin dataset. I initially set out to see how body mass varies with the species dependent on what island they are on. However, I discovered that there is an uneven distribution of species across the hypothetical islands. Therefore, I chose to look at culmen depth, as based on previous studies done in chicks they found that the dimensions of the beak correlates with body mass (Fahey et al, 2007) [2] I chose not to do culmen length, since depth intrigued me more as it leads one to think that it would help create an increased volume and therefore allow more food to enter within the beak and hence contribute to a heavier body mass. This could be an evolutionary adaptation. Although one may argue that culmen length has a similar function; despite my interests to study depth, I also found most papers tend to focus on length correlations with body mass, therefore wanted to see if a similar trend is found with depth and body mass (McDonald et al, 2003 & Rizzolo et al, 2015). [3,4] I could have also looked at the interaction of depth and length, but I feared this may convolute the data and trends, so I chose to focus on one variable.
# I later also look at the interaction of culmen depth and body mass with the species to see if there are any species-specific trends. 

## Hypothesis:
# Null hypothesis: There will be no significant effect between culmen depth, measured in mm and body mass measured in grams. 
# -	There will be no significant interaction between the correlation between the culmen depth and body mass and the species of the penguin.

# Alternative hypothesis: There will be a significant effect between culmen depth, measured in mm and body mass measured in grams.
# -	There will be a significant interaction between the correlation between the culmen depth and body mass and the species of the penguin.

# The species followed by r are named as such since I was mainly interested in the R^2 value. However, I later found relevance to other values from the summary table.

# I conducted an AIC to see if a certain species may explain the relationship between the variables better, and it seems Chinstrap does as it has the lowest AIC but we cannot definitely say that. This also indicates towards the fit and simplicity of the model too and variation between species models in general.

## Stats Method:
# The methods I used to analyse the data was an ANOVA. The reason I did this was to see the interaction between the two variables: body mass and culmen depth with species. Therefore, I fit a linear regression to understand what is happening and then ran an ANOVA. As aforementioned, I checked that it met the necessary assumptions. Since I was looking at the interactions from a linear regression, there was no need to calculate a mean. I also thought it was worth looking at the R^2 value to understand how strongly correlated the two variables were per species.

## Results:
# Looking at Figure 1B, which shows the correlation, it is easy to spot that there is a positive correlation, which could be argued to be strong. There is some scattering of points, and it would be worth conducting a regression test to see if there is significance. 
# If we consider Figure 2C, which is the ANOVA table, you can see, there is significance in the variables alone and in the interaction. We can see that culmen depth significantly interacts with body mass. Therefore, as body mass increases, culmen depth also increases significantly. 
# Similarly, there is increased body mass per species. Although the ANOVA does not directly tell us which species is the ‘largest’, we can see that there is a significant difference between each species in terms of body mass.
# Finally, we can see that the interaction between culmen depth and species is significant.
# However, it is hard to tell if there is a particular species that is skewing the significant interaction and therefore further research can be done to better subset the data to understand if there is a driving species or if it is an equal contribution. All significant values are very significant which is promising. However, it would have been better to include an AIC test to see what type of ANOVA is most appropriate (interaction or two-way), for example: two-way or interactional. It would also be useful to do a post hoc test, like TukeyHSD.
# With regards to Figure 3A/B, this is a violin plot, showing the of the culmen depth with body mass per species and you can see all the points, as well as the boxplot, which shows how I used the exploratory figure and the results from the ANOVA and regression to inform my choice of plot.

# This is a violin plot to show the distribution of the data with the points and boxplot included. I decided to stick to a consistent colour theme.

I thought this was a useful visual aid based on the results of the ANOVA, since you can how the points vary around the distribution.

## Discussion:
# Therefore, we can see that based on the introduction mentioned at the beginning, the evolutionary theory that increased volume for food will cause an increase in size has significant evidence to support this. However, we cannot tell if this is completely representative as this is assuming that there is sufficient resources to allow the penguin to make full use of the culmen depth available. Additionally, this is not completely representative as the evidence only comes from this one dataset, which refers to penguins; therefore more research needs to be done within other species, but also specifically for culmen depth and not just length! Finally, it would be worth considering if there is a disadvantage to having this correlation, as there may be a trade-off with a larger culmen that we are unaware of. For example, for some male species maximising on sexual displays may impact their immune responses due to a difference in hormones – the handicap theory. One could argue that perhaps there is a sexual basis for this too, a deeper culmen could be more attractive as it indicates the ability to get more food, this is another area that could be further prodded. However, is there a limit to this due to penguin morphology. These are only some of the many things we should consider.

## Conclusion:
# In conclusion, you can see that body mass seems to significantly correlate with culmen depth and therefore may provide evidence for the theory that bigger is better. However, as we know from previous research in other instances, that this is not entirely true. Therefore, further research needs to be conducted to verify that this hypothesis is true in the wider picture. It would also be useful to see if we could do time related studies to see if there has truly been some adaptive evolution for increased culmen depth.
# However, with regards to the bigger picture, it would be useful to see if this significance results in practical implications. For example, could this result in increased survival for the penguin or is there a known ecological advantage for having a larger body mass and culmen depth. Is there a ratio that we could calculate that could be indicative to some extent of penguin fitness as a proxy?
